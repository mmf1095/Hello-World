                    <p class="newcont">We meticulously scout the globe for ethical brands and handpick products after a rigorous quality check. There's nothing on our store that we wouldn't wear ourselves.<br> 
                        We visit ethical and fashion forums and events around the world, meet the brand owners and review their collection and then chose the products from the shortlisted brands. Our experts scrupulously check products in terms of sustainability, quality, craftsmanship, ingredients and origin before recommending them.<br>
                        We are passionate about what we do and we believe in working with people who share the same passion.<br>
                        We believe shopping should be an enjoyable experience and instead of rummaging from 1000s of pieces, most of which are not worthy of our time, we should have more relevant choices. We do all that work and only bring you the best of ethical fashion, never compromising on quality or style.</p>

                        When Shruti and Ritika could not find quality vegan products for their wardrobes they decided to take things in their own hands and started Address Chic.<br>
                        Shruti Jain has a background in finance, where she worked as a wealth manager for over eight years before starting Address Chic. Sheâ€™s has received various awards and accolades, including  Women Entrepreneurship Award, in her previous stint and has contributed various articles to top leading financial dailies and magazines.<bt>
                    Ritika Kasliwal is an early-age entrepreneur. She first started a digital marketing company MMF Technologies along with her brother at an age of 21. Today her company has a young team of more than 200 members and she services clients from all over the world.

                                        <p class="newcont">
                                            In 2014, Shruti Jain left her job to start her own business. She never had any background in fashion but her passion for promoting cruelty-free fashion and frustration with the lack of quality retail store and one single platform to talk about a 100 percent ethical lifestyle led her to build Address Chic. Along with being an ethical stylist and Founder of Address Chic, she is also the Editor of Address Chic's digital publication.</br>
                                            She loves vegan smoothies and swears by 100% cruelty-free lifestyle.
